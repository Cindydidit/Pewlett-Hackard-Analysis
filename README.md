# Pewlett Hackard Employee Research Analysis

## Project Overview

Pewlett Hackard â€˜s HR department has assigned me to perform employee research analysis based on established data with the goal of identifying employees who will be retiring next year, as well as determining employees who are eligible to participate in our mentorship program. In addition to the historical data, I used SQL to build a database by applying data modelling, engineering, and analytical skills to deduce how many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? This analysis will provide the company with the necessary insights to identify whether there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees and improve upon the current mentorship program.

## Resources
- Data Sources: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv

The employee research analysis predicts that 132,227 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. The analysis also shows that with a total of 133,776 retiring employees, there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
